/**
 * Notes from the prototyope meetings
 * 
 * I can work in p5!
 * 
 * I can mix the javascript with p5 javascript there's no problem.
 * 
 * To make it feel like a real game, I should make a big rectangle background (really long) and make it go up or down everytime the character goes up (or down)
 * 
 * But to do that, I need to make all the platforms relative to that big backroud
 * for exemple the x of the background would be:
 * x: rectBackground.width/2 - 300
 * so that way when the background moves well all the platforms moves at well
 * 
 * I need to make the speed become faster as it goes on
 * 
 * Maybe that the game could have a time limit, that way there's no way to win or lose, you just try to avoid until the end of the time limit
 * Or, maybe that the level should end immediatly after you miss a platform and explode, then it cuts to the second level
 * the second level being the porcupine going up the same level, but all the buildings are destroyed and nature have taken over
 * 
 * also, I can add the microphone so that when you scream it moves the x, and the louder you scream the faster it moves right
 * and when you stop screaming well the x slowly goes back to it's original place
